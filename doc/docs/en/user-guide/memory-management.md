# Memory Management

Nexent’s intelligent memory system gives agents persistent context. With multi-level memories, agents can remember key facts across conversations, retrieve them automatically, and deliver more personalized answers.

## 🎯 What the Memory System Does

The memory system lets agents “remember” important information and reuse it later without you repeating yourself.

### Core Benefits

- **Cross-conversation memory** – Agents keep track of important facts from earlier chats.
- **Automatic retrieval** – Relevant memories are pulled in automatically.
- **Personalized service** – Responses adapt to user preferences and habits.
- **Knowledge accumulation** – Agents keep getting smarter the more you use them.

## ⚙️ System Configuration

### Access Memory Management

1. Click **Memory Management** in the left navigation.
2. Open the **System Configuration** section.

### Base Settings

| Setting | Options | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Memory Service Status | Enable / Disable | Enable | Controls whether the memory system runs. |
| Agent Memory Sharing Strategy | Always Share / Ask Every Time / Never Share | Always Share | Defines if agents can share memories without user confirmation. |

**Setting Tips**

- **Memory service status** – Disable it if you want a completely stateless experience; enable it to unlock all memory features.
- **Sharing strategy**
  - *Always Share* – Agents exchange memories automatically.
  - *Ask Every Time* – You approve each sharing request.
  - *Never Share* – Agents stay isolated.

## 📚 Memory Levels

Nexent uses four storage levels so you can keep global knowledge and private facts separate.

### Tenant-Level

- **Scope:** Entire organization, shared by all users and agents.
- **Stores:** SOPs, compliance policies, org charts, long-term facts.
- **Best for:** Company-wide knowledge and governance.
- **Managed by:** Tenant administrators.

### Agent-Level

- **Scope:** A specific agent, shared by everyone using it.
- **Stores:** Domain knowledge, skill templates, historical summaries.
- **Best for:** Letting an agent accumulate expertise over time.
- **Managed by:** Tenant administrators.

### User-Level

- **Scope:** A single user account.
- **Stores:** Personal preferences, habits, favorite commands, personal info.
- **Best for:** Tailoring the platform to a specific user.
- **Managed by:** That user.

### User-Agent Level

- **Scope:** A specific agent used by a specific user (most granular).
- **Stores:** Collaboration history, personal facts, task context.
- **Best for:** Deep personalization and long-running projects.
- **Managed by:** That user.

### Retrieval Priority

When an agent retrieves memory it follows this order (high ➝ low):

1. Tenant Level – shared facts and policies.
2. User-Agent Level – very specific context for that pairing.
3. User Level – general personal preferences.
4. Agent Level – the agent’s professional knowledge.

## 🤖 Automated Memory Management

The system takes care of most work for you:

- **Smart extraction:** Detects important facts in conversations and stores them automatically.
- **Context injection:** Retrieves the most relevant memories and adds them to prompts silently.
- **Incremental updates:** Refreshes or removes outdated memories so the store stays clean.

## ✋ Manual Memory Operations

Need full control? Manage entries manually.

### Add a Memory

1. Choose the level (tenant / agent / user / user-agent) and target agent.
2. Click the green **+** button.
3. Enter up to 500 characters describing the fact.
4. Click the check mark to save.

</div>

### Delete Memories

- **Delete group:** Click the red ✕ icon to remove every entry under that agent group (confirm in the dialog).
- **Delete single entry:** Click the red eraser icon to remove one entry.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: left;">
  <img src="./assets/memory/delete-mem.png" style="width: 80%; height: auto;" alt="Delete memory" />
</div>

## 💡 Usage Tips

### Memory Content Guidelines

1. **Keep entries atomic:** Each memory should contain *one* clear fact.
   - ✅ Good: “The user prefers dark mode.”
   - ❌ Not good: “The user prefers dark mode, works nights, and loves coffee.”
2. **Maintain freshness:** Review and remove outdated entries regularly.
3. **Protect privacy:** Store sensitive info at the user or user-agent level instead of tenant level.

### Best Practices

- Pick the memory level that matches the sharing needs.
- Let automation handle routine facts; manually add critical knowledge.
- Review the memory list periodically to keep everything relevant.
- Keep personal or sensitive data scoped tightly to the right user.

## 🚀 Next Steps

With memory configured you can:

1. Experience the new continuity in **[Start Chat](./start-chat)**.
2. Manage all agents in **[Agent Space](./agent-space)**.
3. Build more agents inside **[Agent Development](./agent-development)**.
