# Quick Setup

Quick Setup provides a guided path that walks you through the recommended setup order. Follow the three steps—model management, knowledge bases, and agent development—to get the platform ready fast.

## 📋 Configuration Flow

Quick Setup is organized in the following order:

### Step 1: Model Management

Configure basic app information and connect AI models:

- **App configuration:** Set the icon, name, and description.
- **Model configuration:** Add large language models, embedding models, and vision-language models.

### Step 2: Knowledge Base

Create knowledge bases and upload documents:

- **Create a knowledge base:** Give agents a place to search.
- **Upload files:** Support for multiple file formats.
- **Generate summaries:** Create concise knowledge-base descriptions.

### Step 3: Agent Development

Create and configure agents:

- **Create an agent:** Start from scratch or import an existing configuration.
- **Configure capabilities:** Add collaborative agents and tools.
- **Describe logic:** Tell Nexent how the agent should work.

## 🎯 Tips

1. **Follow the order:** Completing each step in sequence guarantees every dependency is ready.
2. **Save progress:** Click save after finishing each step.
3. **Enable knowledge search:** Add the `knowledge_base_search` tool when you want agents to use local knowledge.
4. **Test early:** After setup, run a few conversations on the chat page to confirm everything works.

## 🚀 Next Steps

After finishing Quick Setup:

1. Visit **[Agent Space](./agent-space)** to review and manage agents.
2. Use **[Start Chat](./start-chat)** to talk to your agents.
3. Configure **[Memory Management](./memory-management)** to give agents persistent memory.
