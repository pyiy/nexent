# Agent Space

Agent Space is the central dashboard for every agent you have built. View agents in card form, inspect their configurations, delete or export them, and jump straight into chats.

## 📦 Agent Cards

Each agent appears as a card showing:

- **Icon** – The agent’s avatar.
- **Name** – The display name.
- **Description** – A quick summary of what it does.
- **Status** – Whether the agent is available.
- **Actions** – Shortcuts for editing, exporting, deleting, and more.

## 🔧 Manage Agents

### View Agent Details

Click a card to open its details:

- **Basic info:** ID, name, description, and status.
- **Model configuration:** Model name, max tokens, business logic model, etc.
- **Prompts:** Role, constraints, examples, and the original description.
- **Tools:** Every tool the agent can use.
- **Sub-agents:** Any collaborative agents that are configured.

### Edit an Agent

1. Click **Edit** on the card.
2. You’ll be taken to the Agent Development page.
3. Adjust the settings and save—updates sync back to Agent Space automatically.

### Delete an Agent
